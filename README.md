# Bitcoin Computer Monorepo

Infrastructure for building Smart Contracts on Litecoin, Bitcoin and other UTXOs-based blockchains.

## Library

* [Bitcoin Computer Lib](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/lib): A library for building smart contracts on Litecoin/Bitcoin. 
* [Bitcoin Computer Node](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/node): It provides trustless access to the [Bitcoin Computer](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/lib). It provides the backend infrastructure for running smart contract based applications. It consists of a Litecoin/Bitcoin node, a database for storing index structures and off-chain data, and a web server.

## Standard Smart Contracts

* [BRC20 contract](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/BRC20): A Bitcoin Computer implementation of the ERC20 Fungible Token Standard. See the [documentation](https://docs.bitcoincomputer.io/advanced-examples/fungible-token/) for more information.
* [BRC721 contract](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/BRC721): A Bitcoin Computer implementation of the ERC751 Non-Fungible Token Standard on Litecoin/Bitcoin. See the [documentation](https://docs.bitcoincomputer.io/advanced-examples/non-fungible-token/) for more information.

## Price

* Testnet: The Bitcoin Computer will be free forever on testnet.
* Mainnet: The fees for the Bitcoin Computer are exactly the same as the miners fees. For example, if the miner transaction fees is $0.01, then you will pay $0.02: one cent to the Litecoin/Bitcoin miners, and one cent to support the development of the Bitcoin Computer.
